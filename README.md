## Description

This website was created to help inform business owners about Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. It stresses the importance of how much a well optimized website can aid in helping grow a business. Throughout refactoring this, I learned why structure and optimization is crucial to aiding people to find websites and make them more accessible with search engines.
